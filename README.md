# FBS-CollegeFootballData


We share the college football network data, in particular the schedules of NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) teams 
in the U.S. between 2014-2017, used in the "Optimal Hierarchical Clustering on a Graph" paper by
Kahvecioglu G. and Morton D.

Some notes about the data: 
** The FBS data only contains the regular-season games
** We do not include the independent teams
** We do not include the teams that did not play all four seasons
** Thus, in total we look at 122 teams
** Contains schedules played within the FBS network
